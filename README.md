# Benchmarks of Erlang Finite Maps

This is currently a quite preliminary repository of various benchmarks
against the finite map types in Erlang. At the moment, there is little
to see here, I am just dumping the source code so other souls can take
a look at it.

# TODO:

Benchmark okeuday's trie structure as well.
